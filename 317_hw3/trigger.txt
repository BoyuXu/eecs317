Create a new table named as “newcp”, it’s a copy of the country table2.	Create a trigger, once there is an update on country which makes the population of one country decreased by 10%, set the population in newcp which shares same continent at its 95%, also set that country’s population as in table “country”3.	Create a event, in every second, let table country equals to table newcp
